First of all I create table from data to work efficiently.

Secondly I define type of variables.

'Price' variable is Quantitative and continious.

'Lotsize! variable is Quantitative and continious.

'Bedrooms' variable looks like Quantitative but it is categorical Nominal.

'Bathroom' , 'Stories', 'garagepl' variable are also categorical Nominal.

'driveaway', 'recroom','fullbase','gashw','airco' and 'prefarea' are categorical binary variables.

Create new column named 'ID' to work easly in frequency tables.

Also create squared difference column that firstly, take difference between average price and observence value in the cell and square the value.
