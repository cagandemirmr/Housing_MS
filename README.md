Secondly I define type of variables.

'Price' variable is Quantitative and continious.

'Lotsize! variable is Quantitative and continious.

'Bedrooms' variable looks like Quantitative but it is categorical Nominal.

'Bathroom' , 'Stories', 'garagepl' variable are also categorical Nominal.

'driveaway', 'recroom','fullbase','gashw','airco' and 'prefarea' are categorical binary variables.
